======================

Conversion of the official Spring Framework Reference to epub, mobi and azw3.

Since the release of the official epub, __no more updates will be done to this project__.

## Official epub now available

Starting from 4.1RC2, **Pivotal is releasing the Spring Reference in epub format**.

You can get the current 4.1 version of the docs at http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/4.1.x/spring-framework-reference/

## Changes

From 4.0.3-RELEASE onwards I have switched to a more automated conversion using Calibre and I can't provide a complete changelog anymore.

For the changes made from 3.2.2 to 4.0.2 check out [changelog-322-402.md](changelog-322-402.md).

## Older versions

You can download older versions of these docs at the [releases](https://github.com/regueiro/spring-reference-ebook/releases) page.


## Development
Created as epub with [Sigil](http://code.google.com/p/sigil/) and optimized using the [Calibre](http://calibre-ebook.com/) converter from the official documentation available at [SpringSource](http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/).

Converted to azw3 and mobi using [Calibre](http://calibre-ebook.com/).
